 <strong>Gasless Transaction -<strong>

Gasless transactions in Ethereum refer to transactions that don't require the user to pay for the computational resources (gas) needed to execute the transaction on the Ethereum network.
These transactions are made possible through techniques such as meta-transactions or relayers, where a third party subsidizes the gas fees on behalf of the user. 
Gasless transactions offer several advantages, including improved user experience by removing the need for users to hold Ether solely for transaction fees and enabling dApp developers to attract more users by eliminating the barrier of entry posed by gas fees.
Additionally, gasless transactions can facilitate various innovative use cases, such as allowing dApps to cover gas fees for their users or enabling transactions on behalf of externally owned accounts (EOAs) without requiring Ether to be present in those accounts.
Overall, gasless transactions represent a significant step towards enhancing accessibility and usability within the Ethereum ecosystem.

<strong>Proof of Stake -</strong>

Proof of stake is a consensus mechanism used to verify new cryptocurrency transactions.
Since blockchains lack any centralized governing authorities, proof of stake is a method to guarantee that data saved on the network is valid. 
Bitcoin on its proof 0f work consensus was very slow and inefficient for blockchain applications, while Ethereum was once a proof of work blockchain,
ethereum now uses proof of stake network. PoS uses randomly selected validators to produce and approve blocks rather than miners.
these validtors "stake" the native network's token by locking them into the blockchain.
In return they receive rewards based on their total stake,incentivizing nodes to validate the network based on a return on investment .
