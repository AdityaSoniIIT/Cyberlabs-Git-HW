   <br><strong>Gasless Transaction</strong> -

   Gasless transactions in Ethereum refer to transactions that don't require the user to pay for the computational resources (gas) needed to execute the transaction on the Ethereum network. These transactions are made possible through techniques such as meta-transactions or relayers, where a third party subsidizes the gas fees on behalf of the user. Gasless transactions offer several advantages, including improved user experience by removing the need for users to hold Ether solely for transaction fees and enabling dApp developers to attract more users by eliminating the barrier of entry posed by gas fees. Additionally, gasless transactions can facilitate various innovative use cases, such as allowing dApps to cover gas fees for their users or enabling transactions on behalf of externally owned accounts (EOAs) without requiring Ether to be present in those accounts. Overall, gasless transactions represent a significant step towards enhancing accessibility and usability within the Ethereum ecosystem.

   <br><strong>Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH) </strong>

   Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH) is a type of ScriptPubKey which locks bitcoin to the hash of a public key. A P2PKH transaction is one where the inputs were locked using the P2PKH ScriptPubKey. P2PKH is similar to P2PK transactions, except that the bitcoin is locked to the hash of the public key rather than the public key itself. P2PHK transaction has a locking script, which contains the public key hash (It produces the bitcoin address of the person whom we are trying to send ) and a signature. An unlocking script must be used by the recepient in order to use the bitcoin that is sent in P2PHK transaction. The unlocking script contains the recepient's public key and his signature that he can generate using his private key. The unlocking script when combined with the locking script unlocks the bitcoin. When the recepient tries to unlock the locking script, the public key gets double hashed and checked against the public key hash that we used in our locking script and if it matches the signature is validated against the public key. In this way, money can be transferred using a locking and unlocking script in a P2PHK transaction.
