   <br><strong>Gasless Transaction</strong> -

   Gasless transactions in Ethereum refer to transactions that don't require the user to pay for the computational resources (gas) needed to execute the transaction on the Ethereum network. These transactions are made possible through techniques such as meta-transactions or relayers, where a third party subsidizes the gas fees on behalf of the user. Gasless transactions offer several advantages, including improved user experience by removing the need for users to hold Ether solely for transaction fees and enabling dApp developers to attract more users by eliminating the barrier of entry posed by gas fees. Additionally, gasless transactions can facilitate various innovative use cases, such as allowing dApps to cover gas fees for their users or enabling transactions on behalf of externally owned accounts (EOAs) without requiring Ether to be present in those accounts. Overall, gasless transactions represent a significant step towards enhancing accessibility and usability within the Ethereum ecosystem.

<br><strong>Transactions in blockchain in actual terms</strong>

    However the most popular form of transaction is  transfer of digital assets like cryptocurrencies; blockchain also encompass changes in information or data stored on the blockchain. These transactions are recorded on blocks, which are then linked together to form an immutable ledger.It is just like in thermodynamics, we know entropy of a system is ΔS, but a slight change and now entropy of universe is ΔS'. For example, let's consider a supply chain management system implemented on a blockchain. When a product moves from one stage of the supply chain to another, such as from manufacturing to distribution, this change in status is recorded as a transaction on the blockchain. Each transaction includes details like the product's identification, timestamps, and relevant metadata. This transaction is validated and added to the blockchain, providing an immutable record of the product's journey. Such information transactions are crucial for ensuring transparency, traceability, and accountability across various industries, from food safety to logistics and beyond.

   <br><strong>Forking</strong>

   Forking in the context of blockchain technology refers to the process by which a blockchain network diverges into two separate paths due to a fundamental disagreement among participants regarding the rules governing the blockchain's operation. There are two main types of forks: soft forks and hard forks. Soft forks occur when changes to the blockchain protocol are backward compatible, tightening the rules of consensus while allowing non-upgraded nodes to still function within the network. On the other hand, hard forks are not backward compatible and result in a permanent split of the blockchain into two separate chains, each following different sets of rules. Forks can be planned, scheduled upgrades to the blockchain protocol, or contentious, arising from significant disagreement within the community about proposed changes. While forking allows blockchain networks to adapt and evolve, it can also introduce uncertainty and volatility, as participants may disagree on the direction of the network and the validity of different chains.

<br><strong>Smart Contracts</strong> -

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of theagreement directly written into code. Operating on blockchain technology,they automatically execute and enforce when predefined conditions are met,without the need for intermediaries. These contracts are revolutionizing variousindustries by providing transparency, security, and efficiency in transactions. With their immutable nature and decentralizedarchitecture, smart contracts eliminate the need for trust between parties,as the terms are enforced by the underlying blockchain network. They hold immense potential for streamlining processes infinance, supply chain management, real estate, and beyond, promising to reshape the future of contract execution and business interactions.
